  route_registrar.routes:
    description: |
      * Array of hashes determining which routes will be registered.
      * Each hash should have 'port', 'uris', 'registration_interval'
        and 'name' keys.
      * 'registration_interval' is the delay between
        routing updates. It must be a time duration represented as a string
        (e.g. "10s").
        It must parse to a positive time duration i.e. "-5s" is not permitted.
      * Additionally, the 'tags' and 'health_check' keys are optional.
      * 'uris' is an array of URIs to register for the 'port'.
      * 'tags' are included in metrics that gorouter emits to support filtering.
      * 'health_check' is a hash which should have 'name' and 'script_path'.
      * 'health_check.timeout' is optional.
        If the health_check timeout is not provided, it defaults to half of the
        value of `registration_interval`.
        If it is provided it must be a time duration represented as a string (e.g. "10s"),
        and less than the value of `registration_interval`.
        It must parse to a positive time duration i.e. "-5s" is not permitted.
      * if the healthcheck is not configured, the route is continually registered.
      * if the healthcheck script exits with success, the route is registered.
      * if the healthcheck script exits with error, the route is unregistered.
      * if a timeout is configured, the healthcheck script must exit within the timeout,
        otherwise it is terminated (with `SIGKILL`) and the route is unregistered.
